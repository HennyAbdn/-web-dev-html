    <h1> History of Inverness</h1>
    
    <p> Inverness (/ɪnvərˈnɛs/ (About this soundlisten); from the Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Nis [iɲɪɾʲˈniʃ],
    meaning "Mouth of the River Ness"; Scots: Innerness) is a city in the Scottish Highlands.
    It is the administrative centre for The Highland Council and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands.
    Historically it served as the county town of the county of Inverness-shire.
    Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th-century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne against Norway
    which took place on the Aird, and the 18th century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor
    It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann Mòr)
    at its northeastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Beauly Firth. 
    At the latest, a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted
    by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century.
    Inverness and Inverness-shire are closely linked to the Clan MacKenzie.</p>
